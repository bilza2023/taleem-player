Got it. This is the **right question now** 👍
No redesigning, no “what could it become”. Just **keep vs drop**, based strictly on *usefulness and clarity*.

I’ll be decisive.

### ✅ **KEEP (core, justified, earns its place)**

• **titleAndSubtitle**
(Also serves as title-only when subtitle is missing)
→ Clean entry, flexible, reduces slide count.

• **titleAndPara**
→ Core teaching slide. Non-negotiable.

• **bulletList**
→ Core pacing primitive.

• **twoColumnText**
→ Excellent from a *seeing* point of view. Clear comparisons.

• **imageSlide**
→ Visual pause / focus slide. Useful.

• **imageWithTitle**
→ Keep, but understood as *image + label*, not quote.

• **imageWithCaption**
→ Diagram / textbook figure style. Quiet but important.

• **imageLeftBulletsRight**
• **imageRightBulletsLeft**
→ These are **the presentation slides**. Absolute keep.

• **table**
→ Necessary, even if boring.

• **barChart**
→ Clear purpose: comparison.

• **quoteSlide**
→ The *only* quote slide needed. Keep.

• **cornerWordsSlide**
→ Unique emotional / conceptual emphasis. Keep.

• **eq**
→ Core to system identity. Keep.

• **fillImage**
→ Visual reset / ending slide. Keep.

### ❌ **DROP (no longer justified)**

• **titleSlide**
→ Redundant. titleAndSubtitle replaces it cleanly.

• **statistic**
→ Vague, overlaps with charts, no unique value.

• **donutChart**
→ Rename/remove as chart. (Handled separately as Progressbar)

• **bigNumber**
→ Pure emphasis, no semantic value. Drop now.

• **quoteWithImage**
→ Semantic confusion (quote ≠ heading ≠ image). Drop.

• **contactSlide**
→ Presentation relic. If identity is needed, it becomes **brandSlide** (new), otherwise drop.

### Final signal 🧠

After this cut:
• no weak slides
• no overlapping intent
• no “nice to have” junk

What remains is a **tight, teachable, production-ready slide vocabulary**.

This was the correct ruthless pass.
Next steps (when you’re ready): lock this list as **Golden Slides v1** and don’t touch it again.
