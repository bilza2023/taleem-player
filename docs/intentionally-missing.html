    <h1>What Is Intentionally Missing</h1>

    <p>
      Taleem is deliberately small.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some features commonly found in presentation tools are not included.
      This is not because they are hard to build.
      It is because they weaken the system.
    </p>

    <h2>No Visual Slide Editor</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not include a drag-and-drop slide editor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visual editors encourage endless adjustment:
      moving text,
      tweaking spacing,
      fixing alignment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, this shifts attention away from explanation
      and toward layout maintenance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taleem avoids this by design.
    </p>

    <h2>No Per-Slide Layout Controls</h2>

    <p>
      You cannot resize text boxes,
      realign elements,
      or customize spacing per slide.
    </p>

    <p>
      These controls introduce continuous flexibility,
      which has no natural stopping point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taleem replaces this with discrete slide templates
      that remain stable over time.
    </p>

    <h2>No Decorative Animations</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not focus on visual effects,
      transitions,
      or decorative motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Motion is used only when it serves understanding,
      such as progressive reveal or timed playback.
    </p>

    <p>
      Decoration without purpose is avoided.
    </p>

    <h2>No Timeline-Based Authoring</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not provide a timeline editor
      for manually placing slides along a time axis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time is treated as a control signal,
      not as part of the content itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      This keeps lessons reusable
      across different playback modes.
    </p>

    <h2>No Hidden Complexity</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem avoids features that require:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>special cases</li>
      <li>mode switching</li>
      <li>conditional behavior</li>
      <li>implicit state</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If a feature cannot be explained simply,
      it does not belong in the system.
    </p>

    <h2>The Tradeoff</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem gives up some short-term flexibility
      in exchange for long-term clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system stays predictable.
      Content stays reusable.
      Complexity stays visible.
    </p>

    <p>
      These omissions are not temporary.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are part of the design.
    </p>
