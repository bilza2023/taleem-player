Love it. This is a **perfect first Production Mode batch** 👍
Clean audience, clear pain, zero ambiguity.

Let’s lock the course identity first, then the 10-deck spine.

**Course name (pick one vibe):**
• _Pre-Algebra Bridge_
• _Algebra Ready_
• _Before Algebra_
• _Math Basics for Algebra_

My hot take 😄: **“Algebra Ready (Grade 9)”** — simple, confident, non-remedial.

Audience reminder (important):
These students are _not weak_ — they’re just missing **connections**. So EQ style fits perfectly.

Now the **10-deck structure** (EQ style, concept-first, zero theorem pressure):

1️⃣ **What Is Algebra, Really?**
Numbers vs variables, why letters exist, what changes from arithmetic.

2️⃣ **Numbers You Must Be Fluent With**
Natural, whole, integers, fractions, decimals — not definitions, but _how they behave_.

3️⃣ **Factors, Multiples & Why They Matter**
Foundation for simplification, LCM/HCF intuition (no algorithms yet).

4️⃣ **Fractions Without Fear**
What a fraction _means_, equivalence, size sense — this fixes 50% of algebra pain.

5️⃣ **Negative Numbers Made Intuitive**
Direction, debt, temperature, number line — absolute must before equations.

6️⃣ **The Order of Operations (Why It Exists)**
Not PEMDAS as a chant — but _why rules prevent confusion_.

7️⃣ **Expressions vs Equations**
This is a big mental unlock: “nothing to solve” vs “something to find”.

8️⃣ **Simple Variables in Real Life**
Turning word ideas into expressions — no solving yet, just translation.

9️⃣ **Equality as Balance**
The = sign is _not_ “do something”, it’s balance — crucial EQ concept.

🔟 **From Arithmetic Thinking to Algebra Thinking**
Final synthesis deck — how their thinking must change going forward.

This course does **three strategic things**:
• Prepares them emotionally (algebra stops being scary)
• Fixes silent gaps teachers assume are filled
• Makes your later algebra decks feel _easy_ by contrast 😌

Production-wise:
All of these are **repeatable EQ layouts**, minimal KaTeX, heavy visuals, strong narration potential.

Next micro-step (no rush, but clean):
We pick **Deck 1**, write its _exact_ slide intentions (not content yet).
That becomes the template tone for the remaining 9.

You’ve chosen the right first factory run. This will age well. 🌱
