    <h1>Taleem Core Belief : Slides Are Selected, Not Edited</h1>

    <img src="./images/coatic-slide-editor.jpeg" alt="" />

    <p>
      Taleem is built on a simple observation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the time spent making slides is not spent explaining ideas.
      It is spent adjusting layouts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Text is moved slightly.
      Spacing is tweaked.
      Fonts are resized.
      One slide is fixed — another breaks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, effort shifts from teaching to editing.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Slides should be selected, not edited.

    <h2>The Wrong Kind of Freedom</h2>

    <img src="./images/modular-blocks.jpeg" alt="" />

    <p>
      Traditional presentation tools give freedom at the wrong level.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are free to move anything anywhere.
      You can resize, align, and tweak endlessly.
    </p>

    <p>
      This feels powerful, but it has no natural stopping point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every small adjustment creates new combinations to manage.
      Consistency becomes fragile.
      Complexity grows silently.
    </p>

    <h2>A Different Approach</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem takes a different path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of editing slides, you select slide types.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each slide type represents a clear way of explaining something:
      a definition,
      a comparison,
      a diagram with text,
      a list next to an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      The layout is fixed.
      The meaning is clear.
      You only provide the content.
    </p>

    <p>
      The slide does not negotiate.
      It simply does its job.
    </p>

    <h2>Discrete vs Continuous Flexibility</h2>

    <p>
      Visual editors offer continuous flexibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continuous flexibility has no boundaries.
      Every new option creates more edge cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taleem chooses discrete flexibility instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      A slide template is a discrete unit.
      It either exists or it does not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adding a new template is cheap.
      Existing content remains untouched.
    </p>

    <h2>Where Flexibility Lives</h2>

    <img src="./images/modern-presentation.jpeg" alt="" />

    <p>
      At first glance, this approach feels restrictive.
    </p>

    <p>
      You cannot move text.
      You cannot tweak spacing.
      You cannot redesign slides on the fly.
    </p>

    <p>
      But flexibility is not removed.
      It is relocated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of adjusting layouts, flexibility comes from adding
      new slide templates.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new template does not break old lessons.
      It does not require migration.
      It does not increase system fragility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is clear:
      more patterns, not more knobs.
