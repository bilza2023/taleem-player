    <h1>Non-Goals</h1>

    <p>
      This document lists things Taleem explicitly does not aim to achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are not postponed features.
      They are decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Infinite Flexibility</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not aim to support
      every possible slide layout or visual arrangement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flexibility is achieved through discrete templates,
      not continuous controls.
    </p>

    <h2>Visual Customization per Slide</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not aim to provide
      per-slide customization of fonts, spacing, or alignment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consistency is valued over customization.
    </p>

    <h2>One-Tool-for-Everything</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not try to replace
      whiteboards,
      notebooks,
      or design tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      It focuses on a specific problem
      and leaves other problems to other tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Smart or Adaptive Layouts</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not dynamically adjust layouts
      based on content length or heuristics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slide templates are explicit and predictable.
    </p>

    <h2>Hidden Magic</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem avoids behavior that is difficult to explain
      or reason about.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a feature cannot be described clearly,
      it is not a goal.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Non-Goals Matter</h2>

    <p>
      Non-goals reduce ambiguity.
    </p>

    <p>
      They make it easier to say no,
      and easier to keep the system coherent.
    </p>
