    <h1>Core Belief</h1>

    <p>
      Taleem is built on a simple observation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the time spent making slides is not spent explaining ideas.
      It is spent adjusting layouts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Text is moved slightly.
      Spacing is tweaked.
      Fonts are resized.
      One slide is fixed — another breaks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, effort shifts from teaching to editing.
    </p>

   
    <blockquote>
      Slides should be selected, not edited.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Wrong Kind of Freedom</h2>

    <p>
      Traditional presentation tools give freedom at the wrong level.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are free to move anything anywhere.
      You can resize, align, and tweak endlessly.
    </p>

    <p>
      This feels powerful, but it has no natural stopping point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every small adjustment creates new combinations to manage.
      Consistency becomes fragile.
      Complexity grows silently.
    </p>

    <h2>A Different Approach</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem takes a different path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of editing slides, you select slide types.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each slide type represents a clear way of explaining something:
      a definition,
      a comparison,
      a diagram with text,
      a list next to an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      The layout is fixed.
      The meaning is clear.
      You only provide the content.
    </p>

    <p>
      The slide does not negotiate.
      It simply does its job.
    </p>

    <h2>Discrete vs Continuous Flexibility</h2>

    <p>
      Visual editors offer continuous flexibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continuous flexibility has no boundaries.
      Every new option creates more edge cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taleem chooses discrete flexibility instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      A slide template is a discrete unit.
      It either exists or it does not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adding a new template is cheap.
      Existing content remains untouched.
    </p>

    <h2>Where Flexibility Lives</h2>

    <p>
      At first glance, this approach feels restrictive.
    </p>

    <p>
      You cannot move text.
      You cannot tweak spacing.
      You cannot redesign slides on the fly.
    </p>

    <p>
      But flexibility is not removed.
      It is relocated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of adjusting layouts, flexibility comes from adding
      new slide templates.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new template does not break old lessons.
      It does not require migration.
      It does not increase system fragility.
    </p>

    <p>
      This capability is part of Taleem’s design direction.
      It is planned, but not yet exposed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is clear:
      more patterns, not more knobs.
    </p>

    <h2>What Taleem Refuses to Do</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not provide:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a visual slide editor</li>
      <li>drag-and-drop layouts</li>
      <li>per-slide spacing controls</li>
      <li>decorative animations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These are not missing features.
      They are avoided features.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Taleem Is For</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem is for people who care about:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>clear explanations</li>
      <li>consistency</li>
      <li>reuse</li>
      <li>stability over time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It is for teachers, educators, and systems that generate content.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not for pixel-level designers.
      It is not for visual experimentation.
    </p>

    <h2>The Belief</h2>

    <p>
      Showing information is a finite problem.
      Editing layouts is not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taleem chooses to solve the finite problem well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything else follows from this choice.
    </p>

    <h2>What You Can Build With Taleem</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not lock you into a single way of using slides.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The same slide content can be presented in different ways,
      depending on the engine and user interface built around it.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Index-based slide navigation</strong><br />
        Move through slides one by one using next and previous controls,
        similar to a traditional presentation.
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Automatic slide playback</strong><br />
        Advance slides automatically using a time-based engine,
        without manual interaction.
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Image galleries</strong><br />
        Display slides as a browsable gallery of visuals,
        without presentation-style controls.
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Filtered or single-purpose viewers</strong><br />
        Show only certain types of slides,
        such as image-only or text-only views.
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Presentations synced with audio</strong><br />
        Coordinate slide changes with narration or recorded explanations.
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Progressive content reveal</strong><br />
        Reveal parts of a slide step by step during playback.
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Progressive display without playback</strong><br />
        Reveal content interactively,
        without time-based presentation or audio.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      These are not different slide formats.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      They are different user interfaces built on top of the same slides.
    </p>
