    <h1>What Is Intentionally Missing</h1>

    <p>
      Taleem deliberately excludes several features commonly found in
      presentation systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      These omissions are not technical limitations. They are design
      decisions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Timeline-based playback engines</li>
      <li>Complex animations and transitions</li>
      <li>Visual slide editors</li>
      <li>Advanced equation and pointer slides</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These features may be added later, but only after real teaching
      experience justifies them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stability and clarity take precedence over feature count.
    </p>
