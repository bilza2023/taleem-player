    <h1>What Taleem Is Not</h1>

    <p>
      Taleem is intentionally narrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand what it does well,
      it is important to understand what it is not trying to be.
    </p>

    <h2>Not a Visual Slide Editor</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem is not a drag-and-drop slide builder.
    </p>

    <p>
      You cannot visually arrange elements,
      resize text boxes,
      or fine-tune layout per slide.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is by design.
    </p>

    <h2>Not a Design Tool</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not aim to compete with
      design-focused tools or presentation software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visual creativity is intentionally constrained
      in favor of clarity and consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>Not a WYSIWYG Authoring Environment</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not show a live, editable canvas while authoring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Content is authored as structured data,
      not manipulated visually.
    </p>

    <h2>Not a Timeline Editor</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not provide a timeline UI
      for placing slides manually in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time is treated as a control concern,
      not as part of lesson content.
    </p>

    <h2>Not an Animation Platform</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not focus on visual effects,
      transitions,
      or decorative animations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Motion is used only when it serves understanding.
    </p>

    <h2>Not a Learning Management System</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem does not manage users,
      courses,
      progress,
      or assessments.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a content and presentation system,
      not a platform.
    </p>

    <h2>The Point</h2>

    <p>
      Taleem chooses depth over breadth.
    </p>

    <p>
      By refusing to be many things,
      it becomes very good at one thing.
    </p>
